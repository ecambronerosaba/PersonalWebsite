      <p>
        Hello! My name is Esteban and I enjoy building things. As a career I've
        focused on building focused around software. My interest in software
        development started in my middle school when I was asked to make a
        wbesite for a club. I knew from that point that I wanted to focus my
        efforts on software.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy other types of making such as 3D modeling, and
        I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had the opportunity to work at startups as well as intern at Meta
        and now have the privelege of workign at Netflix.
